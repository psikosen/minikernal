# Mini NeoKernel Project

## Overview

This project aims to create a mini kernel inspired by TILCK (Tiny Linux-Compatible Kernel), with additional features focused on AI integration and customization. Our goal is to develop a lightweight, modular kernel that incorporates modern AI techniques while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.

## Key Features

- **Core Kernel Functionality**: Based on TILCK architecture
- **AI Integration**: NLP module and genetic algorithms for optimization
- **Customizable UI**: Flexible user interface with system monitoring capabilities

## Language

The core kernel is primarily written in C, with some components in Rust for enhanced safety and performance. Higher-level modules may use C++ or Rust.

## Building the Kernel

### Set Up Development Environment

1. Install the required cross-compilation toolchain for your target architecture (e.g., x86, ARM).
2. Set up the build environment as described in the [Development Setup](#development-setup) section.

### Key Components

1. **Bootloader**: We use GRUB to load the kernel into memory and initiate execution.
2. **Kernel Entry Point**: Assembly code that initializes the stack and calls the main kernel function.
3. **Basic Initialization**: Setup of core hardware components (GDT, IDT, interrupt handling, timers).
4. **Memory Management**: Implementations for physical and virtual memory management.
5. **Scheduler**: An adaptive scheduler that uses genetic algorithms for optimization.
6. **System Calls**: Defined interfaces for user-space program interactions.
7. **Device Drivers**: Essential drivers for keyboard, display, and disk I/O.
8. **Filesystem**: A basic filesystem for file and directory management.
9. **User Space**: Infrastructure for running and managing user-space applications.

## Advanced Features

### NLP Module

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Interprets user queries and provides contextual responses.
- **Contextual Recommendations**: AI-driven suggestions for actions and optimizations based on user behavior.

### Genetic Algorithms

- Framework for exploring and optimizing kernel configurations.
- Dynamic resource allocation based on evolutionary strategies.

### Customizable UI

- Flexible UI framework supporting themes and layouts.
- System monitoring widgets for performance metrics and resource usage.
- Comprehensive control panel for system settings and advanced features.

## Development Setup

(Provide detailed instructions for setting up the development environment, including required tools and dependencies.)

## Building and Running

(Provide step-by-step instructions for building and running the kernel, including any necessary configuration steps.)


## Nice to haves future :D
## Core Technologies

### Adaptive Scheduler

Our scheduler uses machine learning algorithms to dynamically adjust its behavior based on current workloads and system conditions.

- Workload pattern recognition for predictive scheduling
- Dynamic priority adjustment based on historical data
- Real-time performance metrics analysis for immediate adaptations

### Machine Learning-Driven Resource Management

NeoKernel employs on-device machine learning to optimize resource allocation, improving overall system efficiency.

- Predictive memory management to reduce paging and swapping
- Intelligent I/O scheduling based on usage patterns
- Dynamic CPU frequency scaling optimized for energy efficiency and performance

### Modular Architecture

Built with a plug-and-play approach, NeoKernel allows for easy customization and updating of kernel components.

- Hot-swappable device drivers
- Dynamically loadable kernel modules
- Configurable system call interface

### Advanced Power Management

Sophisticated power-saving techniques designed for modern, diverse computing environments.

- Fine-grained component-level power control
- Workload-based power profile switching
- Thermal-aware task scheduling

### Enhanced Security Framework

A multi-layered approach to kernel and system security, focusing on proactive measures.

- Real-time kernel integrity checking
- Sandboxed kernel module execution
- Automated vulnerability scanning and patching

### Hybrid Language Approach

Leveraging the strengths of both C and Rust to create a kernel that is both performant and secure.

- C for low-level, performance-critical components
- Rust for system-critical components requiring memory safety
- Seamless interoperability between C and Rust modules

### Container-Native Design

Built from the ground up with containerization in mind, supporting modern microservices architectures.

- Lightweight containerization support at the kernel level
- Efficient inter-container communication mechanisms
- Resource isolation and control groups (cgroups) integration

## Building NeoKernel

### Prerequisites

- GCC and LLVM/Clang compilers
- Rust toolchain (latest stable version)
- QEMU for testing and emulation
